                <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci was motivated by his unlimited desire for knowledge. This guided all his thinking and behavior. As an artist and a thinker, he was highly visual. He considered sight to be the highest of the senses. To him every phenomenon perceived became an object of knowledge. Leonardo applied his rigorous sight and creativity to numerous fields, including painting, architecture, and engineering and to the study of human anatomy.

                <p>Early on, Leonardo found a balance between technique and expressiveness, as seen in his Adoration of the Magi, from 1482. In addition, he honed his technique of “sfumato,” or shading with soft outlines or haziness, to further his emotive but precise painting

                <p>Leonardo’s interest in science did not stop with anatomy. He studied hydraulic engineering. He even sketched a flying machine with wings and a “helical airscrew” that almost seems a prototype for the modern helicopter

                <p>Leonardo’s early anatomical studies were thorough in their consideration of parts of the body as well as how those parts worked together. He was especially interested in the brain, heart, and lungs
